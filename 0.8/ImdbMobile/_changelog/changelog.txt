TODO list:
- in QVGA mode in main menu icons are chopped off.
- in QVGA mode the rating (stars + rating) is outside the screen.
- In the Settings screen, if I scroll down with the scroll bar to the bottom of the screen and then tap the 'Thumbnail Cach Path', the keyboard activates and screen repositions the field under the keyboard.
- Set userfeedback on the listings pages. on selecting things.
- if Actor (or any PERSON) is dead, pls add date-of-death to his property-page
- pls add Year-of-Production to the Property-Page of a Movie 
great would be user-settable font-sizes .. on my WVGA (Diamond 2) lots of stuff
gets rendered way too large
- Just a cosmetic issue in the Filmography screen - some of the titles need truncating as they are too long to fit the available screen width. For example, with Sam Raimi, he has Filmography entries under 'Second Unit Director or Assistant Director' and 'Camera and Electrical Department' which then seem to affect line spacing too.
- I have a small request, can you add an entry in settings to allow one to select the default Samsung Streaming Player which is located at:

\\\Program Files\Samsung\Streaming Player\ASPlayer.exe

Alternatively, maybe you could implement a browse-to-file button to select any custom players. Or even just allow copy & paste to function in that field.
